# Home_Run_Derby


This project breaks down the data for every home run hit during Major League Baseball's 2019 Home Run Derby held at Progressive Field in Cleveland, Ohio. The data was provided by Baseball Savant (https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/hr_derby).

Provided was data for the distance, exit velocity (speed at which the ball was hit), and launch angle (the angle at which the ball was hit). This data was used in various ways to compare each of the 8 batters who participated in the Home Run Derby. 


<h1>Visualizations</h1>

1) Home Run Distance Map - Each batter's home run distances are added together. Each ring on the map shows how far away from home plate the balls hit by each batter would have traveled.

2) Number of Home Runs By Launch Angle - All home runs grouped by the angle at which they were hit.

3) 90 Degree Chart - Every home run plotted by launch angle and distance.

4) Distance vs Exit Velocity - Every home run plotted by distance and exit velocity, with radius size of each determined by launch angle.
